# Task 6 – Subqueries and Nested Queries

## 🎯 Objective:
Use subqueries in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM` clauses to build advanced SQL queries.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- MySQL Workbench / DB Browser for SQLite

## 📁 Files Included:
- `task6_queries.sql` – Contains all SQL queries using subqueries and nested logic
- (Optional) `output_screenshot.png` – Screenshots showing query outputs

## 🔑 Key Concepts Used:
- Scalar subqueries
- Correlated subqueries
- Subqueries with IN, EXISTS
- Derived tables using subqueries in FROM
- Filtering using nested queries

## 🧠 Learning:
This task improved my understanding of advanced SQL logic and helped me differentiate between types of subqueries.

## 🧩 Sample Queries:
1. Scalar subquery to calculate average salary
2. Correlated subquery to compare salaries within departments
3. Use of `EXISTS` to filter rows based on related tables

## 📝 Notes:
- Queries tested and executed in MySQL Workbench.
- Faced some challenges with correlated subqueries but resolved them using aliases properly.
